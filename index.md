A serialization library with built-in support for forward-backward compatibility (schema evolution) and validation.

Available serialization formats:

* `protobuf`
* `protostuff` (native)
* `graph` (protostuff with support for cyclic references. See SerializingObjectGraphs)
* `json`
* `smile` (binary json useable from the protostuff-json module)
* `xml`
* `yaml` (serialization only)
* `kvp` (binary [uwsgi](http://projects.unbit.it/uwsgi) header)

Support for messages that are generated by the `protostuff-compiler (java_bean)`:

* cyclic references via graph format
* see CompilerOptions for more customized compilation of `.proto` files

Support for existing pojos (See runtime schemas):

* cyclic references via graph format
* polymorphic (a nested message can be an interface/abstract class or even java.lang.Object)

Support for existing protoc-generated java messages:

* see the io instructions for json, xml, yaml)
* no support for cyclic references (limitation of the builder pattern)

Interoperability across various mobile platforms:

* android
* kindle
* j2me (protostuff-me module)

Transcoding support:

* converts one encoding to another. See PipeUsage.
* Source and Sink
    * protostuff, protobuf, json, json-numeric, smile, smile-numeric, xml
* Sink only
    * yaml
